# Metadata

We have two editor versions. If you'd prefer to edit title and tags etc. as separate fields, switch to the "rich + markdown" option in Settings Â» UX. Otherwise, continue...

This editor is a markdown editor that uses Jekyll front matter.
Most of the time, you can write inline HTML directly into your posts.
We support native Liquid tags and created some fun custom ones, too! Trying embedding a Tweet or GitHub issue in your post.
Links to unpublished posts are shareable for feedback/review.
When you're ready to publish, set the published variable to true.
Front Matter
Custom variables set for each post, located between the triple-dashed lines in your editor. Here is a list of possibilities:

title: the title of your article
published: boolean that determines whether or not your article is published
description: description area in Twitter cards and open graph cards
tags: max of four tags, needs to be comma-separated
canonical_url: link for the canonical version of the content
cover_image: cover image for post, accepts a URL.
The best size is 1000 x 420.
series: post series name.
