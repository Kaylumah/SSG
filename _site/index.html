  <h1 class="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl">Hi, I am <span class="bg-brand-green text-gray-100 px-1 rounded-lg">Max Hamulyák</span>, the founder of <span class="bg-brand-green text-gray-100 px-1 rounded-lg">Kaylumah</span></h1>

    I founded Kaylumah in 2020 as my side-business. It enabled me to pursue my
    projects and goals. At the moment, it is not my goal to be fully
    self-employed, but having my own company and branding will serve as an
    enabler.

    Since I am from 1995 and graduated from my bachelor HBO-ICT in 2016, I am
    still in the early stages of my career. After my graduate internship at a
    company then called QNH, now ilionx, I was lucky enough to get a mentor that
    opened my eyes. His message sounded deep within mee. I realised that it
    should also be part of my company slogan: "Building a solid solution is more
    important than the technology used".

    So what can you find on my website? You can find information about me,
    projects that I have worked on, and my company. I also think it is time to
    pay it forward. So I decided to start blogging. I will share lessons
    learned, experiments done. Feel free to reach out and contact me. Let me
    know if I can help you, and what you think about my ramblings.
