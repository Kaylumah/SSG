title: "Why tailwind is the framework that almost makes me like css again"
description: "Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. This isn't a car. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area."

# Intro
For years there has been a single aspect of front-end development that I didn't enjoy. That is writing css.
Hate may be a strong word, so let say I had a strong dislike against writing css. Then along came [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com){: .external }.


# Installing

```sh
npm init -y
npm install tailwindcss
```
