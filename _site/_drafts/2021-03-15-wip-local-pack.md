title: 'Share NuGet packages via local feed.'
description: ''
---
NuGet is the Microsoft-supported package manager for .NET. A NuGet package is a single zip file with the `.nupkg` extension.
It contains the dlls and other files related to the code, such as a descriptive manifest.

NuGet package can be shared via both public and private hosts. This way you can share code that is exclusive to your organization. In fact the package is just a shareable unit of code, but the means of sharing is up to you. For example, you might want to use a local copy of a package to test it in a project before sharing it with others.

Today we are looking at local package feeds.

## Step ? Create a NuGet Config.

For any project I do I create a NuGet Config in the root of my project. By doing so I make sure that any NuGet configuration on my machine does not influence the build result. So if I have a private nuget feed configured for my project, its right there in my project instead of hidden in some global nuget config.

You can create a `nuget.config` by running `dotnet new nugetconfig` Which looks likes the sample below when created.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <!--To inherit the global NuGet package sources remove the <clear> line below -->
    <clear />
    <add key="nuget" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

The cool thing is that you don't need a server to try out new packages. NuGet supports the use of a local feed. You can create a local feed by running `dotnet nuget add source ./packages --name "Local Feed"` whichs adds the following line to the package sources in the NuGet config. `<add key="Local Feed" value="./packages" />`

### Package License

| Element | Outputs |
| - | - |
| `<PackageLicenseFile>` | The name of the license file in the NuGet Package. |
| `<PackageLicenseFileFullPath>` | The full path to the LICENSE file, tries to resolve via `$(RepoRoot)/License.txt` or defaults to `SDK/Assets/License.txt`. |
